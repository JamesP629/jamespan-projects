**Diabetes Predictive Analysis Project**

This project trains and uses 5 different models to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. The goal of this project is to help diagnose diabetes early, which would allow the patients to get ahead of the disease and make those lifestyle changes to reduce the impact of diabetes on their life. The dataset chosen is a collection of survey results that contain possible diabetes indicators and whether or not the patient has diabetes.
