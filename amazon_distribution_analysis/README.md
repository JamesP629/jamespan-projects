**Amazon Distribution Analysis**

This project simulates and analyzes Amazon's inventory operations using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The goal of this project is to evaluate inventory metrics, such as cycle inventory, safety stock, average inventory, and service level.

Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Monte Carlo Simulation (200 iterations)
- Probability Distributions

Problem Overview
Amazon must decide which warehouse to stock lightweight items for, taking into account key variables such as:
- Uncertain Customer Demand
- Tradeoffs between shipping costs, holding costs, and service levels

Simulation Logic
Key Inputs
- Weekly Demand: Modeled with a normal distribution
- Lead Time: Uniform Distribution
- Order Quantity: Fixed at 1000 units
- Holding Cost Rate:
- Service Level Target
